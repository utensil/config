# Config

**Config** is a basic checklist I follow to set up a productive development environment. Inspired by [mdo/config](https://github.com/mdo/config/).

## Contents

| File | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `.bash-profile` | TODO |
| `.gitconfig` | Global Git configuration to specify my name and email, shortcuts, colors, and more. |
| `Preferences.sublime-settings` | My Sublime Text 3 user preferences. |

## Checklist

TODO

## Use it yourself

Fork this repo, or just copy-paste things you need, and make it your own. **Please be sure to change your `.gitconfig` name and email address though!**

## Works on my machine

Yup, it does. Hopefully it does on yours as well, but please don't hate me if it doesn't.
