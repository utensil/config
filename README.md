Config
=================

**Config** is a basic checklist I follow to set up a productive development environment. Inspired by [mdo/config](https://github.com/mdo/config/).

Content organization
--------------------------

```
├─IDE                   
│  ├─atom         # Atom configurations
│  └─sublime      # Sublime Text 3 configurations
└─OS              # development environment setup on different operating system: Ubuntu(actually Mint), Mac(Notebook Pro) and Windows
```

## Works on my machine

Yup, it does. Hopefully it does on yours as well, but please don't hate me if it doesn't.
